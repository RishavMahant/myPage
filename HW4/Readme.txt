I only edited the pacific.css file. By only editing it, it was kinda tricky but as the professor said
simplicity is the key here. So by just adding some extra style functions and adding colors, wallpapers
and using google as a reference to help me out was very interesting.

I really liked how the professor gave us the images to adapt to the wallpapers and images gif for the bullet points.

All in all it was a good assignment to be a part of.
